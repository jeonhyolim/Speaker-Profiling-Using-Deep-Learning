# Speaker-Profiling-Using-Deep-Learning
Co-Deep Learning Project(2021 Fall Semester), Sungkyunkwan University, 2nd Award üèÜ

In this project, our team implemented a "Speaker profiling deep learning model" to infer gender, age, and dialect from voice data with team members. We determined that the effects of the speaker's gender, age, and dialect on the voice are not independent, so we implemented a hard parameter sharing CNN and C-LSTM, a multiclass multioutput model in which the feature values extracted from each task are reflected in each other. Compared to CNN and RNN implemented separately, both improved accuracy and time.

The project won a 2nd-place award at CO-Deep Learning, an intramural competition at Sungkyunkwan University, and has been patented.
